[21;1H[1mOPTIONS[0m
[22;1H       In  addition to tsion[0m
       [4mBrace[24m  [4mexpansion[24m  is a mechanism by which arbitrary strings may be generated.  This
       mechanism is similar to [4mpathname[24m [4mexpansion[24m, but the filenames  generated  need  not
       exist.   Patterns  to be brace expanded take the form of an optional [4mpreamble[24m, fol-
       lowed by either a series  of  comma-separated  strings  or  a  sequence  expression
       between a pair of braces, followed by an optional [4mpostscript[24m.  The preamble is pre-
       fixed to each string contained within  the  braces,  and  the  postscript  is  then
       appended to each resulting string, expanding left to right.

       Brace  expansions  may  be  nested.   The  results  of each expanded string are not
       sorted; left to right order is preserved.  For example, a[1m{[0md,c,b[1m}[0me expands into â€˜ade
       ace abeâ€™.

       A sequence expression takes the form [1m{[0m[4mx[24m[1m..[0m[4my[24m[1m[..[0m[4mincr[24m[1m]}[0m, where [4mx[24m and [4my[24m are either inte-
       gers or single characters, and [4mincr[24m, an optional increment, is  an  integer.   When
       integers  are  supplied,  the  expression  expands  to each number between [4mx[24m and [4my[24m,
       inclusive.  Supplied integers may be prefixed with [4m0[24m to force each term to have the
       same width.  When either [4mx[24m or [4my[24m begins with a zero, the shell attempts to force all
       generated terms to contain the same number of digits, zero-padding where necessary.
       When characters are supplied, the expression expands to each character lexicograph-
       ically between [4mx[24m and [4my[24m, inclusive.  Note that both [4mx[24m and [4my[24m  must  be  of  the  same
       type.   When  the  increment is supplied, it is used as the difference between each

              the  completion  that  match  characters  after point in the word being com-
              pleted, so portions of the word following the cursor are not duplicated.

              If set to [1mOn[0m, a character denoting a fileâ€™s type as reported by  [4mstat[24m(2)  is

   [1mReadline[0m [1mConditional[0m [1mConstructs[0m
       Readline  implements  a  facility  similar in spirit to the conditional compilation
       features of the C preprocessor which allows key bindings and variable  settings  to
       be performed as the result of tests.  There are four parser directives used.

       [1m$if[0m    The  [1m$if[0m construct allows bindings to be made based on the editing mode, the
              terminal being used, or the application using readline.   The  text  of  the
              test  extends  to the end of the line; no characters are required to isolate
              it.

              [1mmode[0m   The [1mmode=[0m form of the [1m$if[0m directive is used to test whether  readline
                     is in emacs or vi mode.  This may be used in conjunction with the [1mset[0m
                     [1mkeymap[0m command, for instance, to set bindings in  the  [4memacs-standard[24m
                     and  [4memacs-ctlx[24m  keymaps  only  if  readline is starting out in emacs
                     mode.

              [1mterm[0m   The [1mterm=[0m form may be used to include terminal-specific key bindings,
                     perhaps  to  bind the key sequences output by the terminalâ€™s function
                     keys.  The word on the right side of the [1m=[0m is tested against the both
                     full name of the terminal and the portion of the terminal name before
                     the first [1m-[0m.  This allows [4msun[24m to match  both  [4msun[24m  and  [4msun-cmd[24m,  for
                     instance.

       search string is used.

       Non-incremental searches read the entire search string before  starting  to  search
       for  matching history lines.  The search string may be typed by the user or be part
       of the contents of the current line.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mBash[0m  is  an [1msh[0m-compatible command language interpreter that executes commands read
       from the standard input or from a file.  [1mBash[0m  also  incorporates  useful  features
       from the [4mKorn[24m and [4mC[24m shells ([1mksh[0m and [1mcsh[0m).

       [1mBash[0m  is intended to be a conformant implementation of the Shell and Utilities por-
       tion of the IEEE POSIX specification (IEEE Standard 1003.1).  [1mBash[0m can  be  config-
       ured to be POSIX-conformant by default.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       In  addition to the single-character shell options documented in the description of
       the [1mset[0m builtin command, [1mbash[0m interprets the following options when it is invoked:

       [1m-c[0m [4mstring[24m If the [1m-c[0m option is present, then commands  are  read  from  [4mstring[24m.   If
                 there are arguments after the [4mstring[24m, they are assigned to the positional
                 parameters, starting with [1m$0[0m.
       [1m-i[0m        If the [1m-i[0m option is present, the shell is [4minteractive[24m.
       [1m-l[0m        Make [1mbash[0m act as if it had been invoked as a login shell (see  [1mINVOCATION[0m
                 below).
       [1m-r[0m        If the [1m-r[0m option is present, the shell becomes [4mrestricted[24m (see [1mRESTRICTED[0m
                 [1mSHELL[0m below).
